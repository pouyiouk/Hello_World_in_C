A simple Hello World in C programming language from 2011 when I was studying at Lancaster University

A simple yet updated 'Hello World' program in C programming language from 2011 when I was studying at Lancaster University as a Software Engineer

To compile a C program:

Open terminal (Unix based Systems)
Direct yourself to the folder where the hello.c file is located
Compile the C file to an executable bash program. Use the command: gcc -o hello hello.c
Run the file using the command: ./hello
Note: You can edit a C file with the in-built text editor of your operating system or you can use the command: gedit hello.c

This applies to any C file you want to edit.
